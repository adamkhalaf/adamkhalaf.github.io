I'm a computer enthusiast. I graduated from the University of Maryland with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering in 2023. In my pastime I enjoy learning about new and existing technologies, playing video games with friends, cooking, and working on my home server.  

I'm currently a Software Engineer at Peraton, where my team and I get to deliver high-quality, impactful results.  

My passion lies in open-source development, an area where I thrive by merging creativity with technical expertise. This work not only sharpens my skills but also aligns with my belief in the power of community-driven technology.

On this website, I document my experience as an engineer, ideas I learn about, and whatever interests me.
